### IT Product Lead Verticals Solutions @ Kuehne + Nagel

I work at Kuehne + Nagel for the Corporate IT Products organisation in Hamburg. Originally from Venezuela, I joined the company in 2011 and have had different roles so far. Today I can better be defined as an IT specialist with a broad range of experience: starting as a software developer, I've been business analyst, agile facilitator, conference speaker and devops engineer. I am a lifelong learner, convinced that if you try hard, you can get good at anything. I like challenges and I face them with energy and courage. I am passionate about continuous improvement & exchanging experiences with the tech community.
