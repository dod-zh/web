### Empowering Teams in Test Automation

I'm an unyielding automation engineer and consultant, helping development teams start or revive automated testing.

My passion for test automation began during my master’s thesis, where I discovered the liberating power of unit tests. Since then, I've led testing initiatives in five large-scale projects across automotive, medical, and insurance industries.

I'm also a regular participant in StorySlam Zurich and was a finalist in 2024, developing my skills to connect with audiences of all backgrounds.
