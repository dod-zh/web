### DevOps Engineer

I’m a passionate advocate for cloud-native application development, particularly using Spring Boot. With a background that blends both DevOps and backend development, I’ve spent my career building efficient, scalable solutions while driving automation and optimization throughout the software lifecycle.
I’m deeply committed to Agile principles and software craftsmanship, with a focus on automating unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, and ensuring high-quality code delivery. My passion for cloud-native applications is rooted in the belief that Spring Boot offers a powerful framework for developing robust, modern applications that are well-suited for today’s distributed cloud environments.
