This hands-on workshop/tutorial examines practical patterns for integrating AI into engineering workflows and automation pipelines, based on our approved multi-day workshop. We'll implement tools that enhance daily tasks: from accelerating technical research and troubleshooting to improving documentation processes and development standardization.

Working with open-source components compatible with any LLM backend, you'll build both interactive assistants and pipeline automation. Learn to craft reliable prompts that produce structured outputs, enabling consistent results across interactive and automated use cases. 

Features real-world examples demonstrating immediate practical value in both personal and pipeline contexts.
