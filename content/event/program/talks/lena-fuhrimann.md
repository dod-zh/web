Together, we play through the ten levels of writing and deploying serverless applications. Each level represents a new challenge that teams who decide to go serverless usually face. The goal of this talk is that we can work our way through these challenges and caveats so that you don't have to face them in your own applications anymore. By doing so, we'll apply best practices, debug and harden your serverless applications based on AWS Lambda and other serverless technologies.
