DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners and enthusiasts. The conference is funded and supported by the sponsors. Essentially, the companies which are successful today and want to support tomorrows ideas when it comes to connecting functional silos.

We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists. Sponsors will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event. Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers. Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.

### NO Speaker Spots

**We do not sell or bundle speaker spots as part of any Sponsoring activities with our conference. Do not ask for it. We don't do it. No DevOpsDays conference does it. Never. Period.**

We encourage everyone, including Sponsor employees, to take part in our open Call for Proposals process. However, working (or any other relation) to a Sponsor does not result in preferences or disadvantages in our selection process.

### NO Attendee Information

**We do not sell or distribute attendee information. Do not ask for it. We don't do it. No DevOpsDays conference does it. Never. Period.**

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers (e.g. via proposing OpenSpace topics). Any Sponsor is free to collect attendee information with mutual consensus at their booth.
