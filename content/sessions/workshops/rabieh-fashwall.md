In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn how to build powerful infrastructure management tools using Kubernetes (K8s) Operators written in Go. Kubernetes Operators extend the functionality of Kubernetes by automating complex, domain-specific tasks, and managing custom resources at scale. Through this workshop, attendees will gain a deep understanding of the Operator pattern, best practices in Operator development, and how Go can be used to create robust, production-grade Operators.

Key topics covered will include:

- Introduction to Kubernetes Operators: What they are, why they're needed, and how they fit into the Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Deep dive into the Operator Framework: Building, testing, and deploying Operators with Go.
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and how to manage lifecycle events of custom resources.
- Best practices for error handling, reconciliation loops, and scalability in Operator development.
- Hands-on labs: Writing a simple Operator in Go to manage real-world infrastructure resources.
- Advanced Operator patterns, including status management, handling upgrades, and building for high availability.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have practical experience building a functional Kubernetes Operator using Go, along with the foundational knowledge needed to develop custom tools for automating and managing infrastructure at scale.
