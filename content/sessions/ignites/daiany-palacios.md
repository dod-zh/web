More than 10 years into the DevOps movement, by now we know that it’s not just a job. We know the truth about DevOps (do we?) and understand that in principle there is not such a thing as a DevOps Engineer or a DevOps Team. Yet, our industry needed to find a label, a way to name the new role which Sysadmins or Developers were further growing into.
Today, job ads for "DevOps Engineers" are everywhere, with diverse descriptions. I went through the hiring process for such a position in my team last year, and after interviewing a decent amount of candidates I started reflecting: How is this role going to evolve in the future? What about the next generation of “DevOps Engineers”? How do we get them “fresh” out of university”? How does someone come to the idea of starting their career in this field at all?
In this ignite talk, I’ll share thoughts on nurturing the next generation of DevOps professionals. With patience, because we need tomorrow’s DevOps Engineers, today! :P
