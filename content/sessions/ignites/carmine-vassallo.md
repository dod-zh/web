### Ignite

What’s the best way to ensure your product truly delivers? Use it yourself. “Eating your own dog food” is more than just a quirky phrase—it’s a practice my team and I embrace every day. By actively using the products we build, we’ve uncovered hidden flaws, improved deployment strategies, and refined configurations based on real-world usage.

In this talk, I’ll share how our team’s commitment to dogfooding has created a strong feedback loop that drives better decisions, builds confidence in new features, and enhances the user experience. Discover why living and breathing your product is the ultimate recipe for success.
