### Ignite

A once-mighty test framework, the pride of a software department, had fallen into disrepair. Complex, unpredictable, and demanding, it had become a burden rather than a boon.

But as development of the framework stalled, quality issues with the application it supported began to creep back. The team faced a daunting challenge: to tame the beast or be consumed by it.

This talk will explore the journey of the tech squad tasked with confronting this legacy system. We'll delve into the challenges encountered, the strategies used, and the lessons learned. Ultimately, we’ll uncover the fate of the test framework: was it tamed into a powerful ally, or did it turn against its keepers, crushing them under its own weight?
