### Ignite

Tesla is arguably one of the hottest companies on the planet right now, with its ambitious goals and industry leading engineering & manufacturing capabilites. But how do they tackle software for their products and enterprise?

In this talk, I will share my insights and observations from following almost every move the company did publicly in the last century as well as using their products. Combined with my understanding and experience in the software world, I’ll highlight areas where their practices become visible to hopefully also spark your interest.

As it will become strikingly apparent very quickly, Tesla has also taken software to the next level across their whole enterprise.
