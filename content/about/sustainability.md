## Our Commitment to the Environment

At DevOpsDays Zurich, we take our environmental responsibility seriously. We're committed to reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainable practices throughout our conference.

## What We're Doing

Here's how we're making DevOpsDays Zurich more sustainable:

### Waste Reduction

- **Minimized printouts** for participants and speakers
- **Reduced packing material** usage
- **Reused banners and flags** from previous years
- **Proper waste sorting** throughout the venue
- **Paper bags** for speaker gifts (no plastic)

### Sustainable Catering

- **Locally produced food** to reduce transportation emissions
- **Vegan options** for all lunches and breaks
- **Minimal single-use plastics** in food service

### Carbon Offset Program

- **We will plant trees for every participant** attending the conference
- Contributing to reforestation efforts in Switzerland

## Addressing Travel Emissions

We are aware that the **largest CO2 emissions are caused by air travel**. Therefore, we have made it our goal to decrease the CO2 emissions caused by flights our speakers take to DevOpsDays year by year.

### Transparency

We calculate the miles our speakers have flown and **make the statistics transparent during the conference**. This helps us track our progress and set meaningful reduction goals.

### Our Goal

Reduce speaker travel emissions by encouraging:

- Train travel within Europe
- Virtual participation options where appropriate
- Regional speaker diversity to reduce long-distance travel

## How You Can Help

As a visitor, you can also contribute to a sustainable conference. We encourage you to:

### Choose Sustainable Transport

1. **Travel by public transport** instead of using a private car
   - Winterthur is well-connected by train and tram
   - [SBB Journey Planner](https://www.sbb.ch/en) for trip planning

2. **Car sharing** - If you must drive, take passengers with you
   - Use our community Slack to find travel companions
   - Reduce emissions per person significantly

3. **Take the train** - If coming from Europe, skip the flight
   - Switzerland's extensive rail network makes this easy
   - More comfortable and scenic than flying!

### During the Conference

- Use reusable water bottles (water stations provided)
- Sort your waste properly
- Share knowledge about sustainable practices
- Support our sustainability partners
