Here is what we do to improve the sustainability of our conference:

- Minimized our use of printouts for participants and speakers
- Minimized our use of packing material
- Reused banners and flags
- Sorted all our waste
- Chose locally produced, vegan food for our lunches and breaks
- Used paper bags for speaker gifts
- We will plant trees for every participant

We are aware that the largest CO2 emissions are caused by air travel. Therefore, we have made it our goal to decrease the CO2 emissions caused by flights our speakers take to the DevOpsDays year by year. That's why we calculate the miles they've flown and will make the statistics transparent during the conference!

Of course, as a visitor, you can also contribute to a sustainable conference. We therefore encourage you to:

- Travel by public transport and not use a private car
- If you have to travel by private car, take passengers with you (car sharing)
- If you are coming from Europe, take the train instead of flying

If you have any more suggestions or ideas, please get in touch using our contact form.

We might not have a solution in every case or right away – but you can be sure that we are passionate and eager to find one!
