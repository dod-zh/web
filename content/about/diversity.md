At DevOpsDays Zürich we don't want to be a tech-conference only — instead we want to be a conference focusing on knowledge, networking and a connecting atmospheric vibe, welcoming a range of backgrounds, experiences and opinions.

Wether you are a speaker or a participant, maybe something's missing for you? Would you be happy to have some mentoring on your first conference talk? Would you need some assistance in getting to Winterthur? Would you need childcare to be at the conference? Whatever it is, please do not hesitate to contact us.

We might not have a solution in every case or right away – but you can be sure that we are passionate and eager to find one! Here's among others what we already thought of:

- trying some sort of "diversity in tech"-stream or talk at the conference itself
- have gender neutral toilets (if feasable with the location)
- check the location with zugangsmonitor.ch
- have reserved seating for people with mobility issues

The access monitor documents the accessibility of cultural institutions for people with a visual, mobility or hearing impairment. Here you can find the accessibility of the Alte Kaserne Winterthur.

We believe in promoting equal opportunities for diverse talents in the IT industry. DevOpsDays Zurich supports the empowering of refugees & migrants for an IT career with a partnership with powercoders.

We encourage girls to discover coding and explore a career in tech. DevOpsDays Zurich supports GirlsCodeToo, a non-profit organization, sparking talent and curiosity by introducing girls to software tools, different coding languages and processes that are used to build apps, games, websites, and robots.

We are committed for the integration of diverse perspectives in tech and innovation. DevOpsDays Zurich is proud to collaborate with Be Like Grace, a network dedicated to fostering inclusion and diversity in Bern's tech scene. By empowering women and embracing varied backgrounds, languages, and cultures, we support Be Like Grace's commitment to enriching workplace discussions, enhancing decision-making, and creating more enjoyable work environments. This partnership reflects our shared belief that diversity not only brings more excitement and fun to our daily work but also drives the creation of superior products and services.
