At DevOpsDays Zürich we don't want to be a tech-conference only — instead we want to be a conference focusing on **knowledge, networking and a connecting atmospheric vibe**, welcoming a range of backgrounds, experiences and opinions.

## We're Here to Help

Whether you are a speaker or a participant, maybe something's missing for you? We want to ensure everyone can participate fully. Here are some examples of how we might be able to help:

- **First-time speaker?** Mentoring for your first conference talk
- **Travel assistance?** Help getting to Winterthur
- **Childcare needs?** Support to attend the conference
- **Accessibility requirements?** Let us know your needs

Whatever it is, **please do not hesitate to contact us**. We might not have a solution in every case or right away – but you can be sure that we are passionate and eager to find one!

## Accessibility Initiatives

Here's what we're already working on:

- **Diversity in Tech** track or dedicated talks at the conference
- **Gender-neutral toilets** (where feasible with the location)
- **Accessibility verification** using zugangsmonitor.ch
- **Reserved seating** for people with mobility issues

The [Access Monitor](https://zugangsmonitor.ch) documents the accessibility of cultural institutions for people with visual, mobility or hearing impairments. You can find the [accessibility details for Alte Kaserne Winterthur](https://zugangsmonitor.ch/alte-kaserne-winterthur) on their website.

## Community Partnerships

We believe in promoting equal opportunities for diverse talents in the IT industry through partnerships with organizations that share our values:

### Powercoders

DevOpsDays Zurich supports the empowering of **refugees & migrants** for an IT career through our partnership with [Powercoders](https://powercoders.org). We believe in breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for talented individuals regardless of their background.

### GirlsCodeToo

We encourage girls to discover coding and explore a career in tech. DevOpsDays Zurich supports [GirlsCodeToo](https://girlscodetoo.ch), a non-profit organization sparking talent and curiosity by introducing girls to:

- Software development tools
- Different coding languages
- App, game, and website development
- Robotics and automation

### Be Like Grace

We are committed to the integration of diverse perspectives in tech and innovation. DevOpsDays Zurich is proud to collaborate with [Be Like Grace](https://belikegrace.com), a network dedicated to fostering inclusion and diversity in Bern's tech scene.

By empowering women and embracing varied backgrounds, languages, and cultures, we support Be Like Grace's commitment to:

- Enriching workplace discussions
- Enhancing decision-making processes
- Creating more enjoyable work environments

This partnership reflects our shared belief that **diversity not only brings more excitement and fun to our daily work but also drives the creation of superior products and services**.
